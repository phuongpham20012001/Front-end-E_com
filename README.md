I'm creating a simple ecommerce website using ReactJS that provides an intuitive and streamlined shopping experience for users. The website will enable customers to easily view products, add them to their shopping cart, and seamlessly view their order history. To ensure the level of security, I am integrating authentication and authorization features that will safeguard sensitive user data. Additionally, I am implementing role-based differentiation to optimize both the interface and functionality based on user roles, ensuring an exceptional user experience for all
